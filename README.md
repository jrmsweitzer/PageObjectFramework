# PageObjectFramework
A Framework for Selenium and PageObjects, with built-in logging support and screenshots.

To use this Framework, you'll have to have Visual Studio installed. I used VS2013 Community Edition, which is free to download
here: http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx

Once you get that installed, you can use VS2013's built-in git support to pull this project.
1. Go to the Team Explorer window. View -> Team Explorer
2. Click the outlet plug at the top (Connect to Team Projects)
3. Click 'Clone'
4. Use URL: https://github.com/jrmsweitzer/PageObjectFramework

You may have to tell VS2013 to update all NuGet packages.

To be continued.....
